## Abstract

 1. Motivation: A dart board game is not only a fun way to pass the time but also serves
as an engaging tool to develop various skills in individuals. The implementation of a Finite
State Machine (FSM)1 in the digital dart game serves as a robust framework to manage the
various states of gameplay efficiently. This game emphasizes precision and timing, making
it an excellent way to enhance focus and hand-eye coordination2. Through this project, we
aim to create a digital version of the classic dart game using innovative digital circuits. By
incorporating features like speed control and a dynamic scoreboard, players can easily track
their scores while experiencing a customizable level of challenge as the game progresses. This
adaptability adds an exciting layer of suspense and engagement to each round!</br>
2. Problem Statement:</br>
• The system must accept input signals that accurately represent dart throws on a virtual
dartboard.</br>
• The dartboard must feature a sufficiently large number of distinct target regions, with
the bullseye being the most challenging to hit.</br>
• Additionally, the game should introduce variations to increase difficulty, ensuring a stim-
ulating experience for players.</br>
• The scoreboard must effectively record game points over a wide range, avoiding overflow
to accommodate prolonged game play .</br>
• The overall objective is to develop a digital dart game that is both entertaining and
capable of accommodating multiple players while providing an intuitive and responsive
game play experience.</br>
3. Features:</br>• The dartboard utilizes an input signal from a dart throw, represented as a time-varying
pointer that periodically navigates among four concentric target regions, illuminated by
LEDs to indicate the pointer’s position.</br>
• The scoreboard can accurately record at least 20 throws without risk of overflow, ensuring
comprehensive tracking of player performance.</br>
• The dartboard includes a variable speed controller, allowing players to adjust the speed
at which the pointer changes position, enhancing the challenge.</br>
• The game is designed for up to three players, promoting friendly competition and social
interaction.</br>
• Penalty will be imposed on the player if the throw time limit is exceeded.</br>
