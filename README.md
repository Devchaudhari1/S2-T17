## 1. Motivation

A dartboard game is not only a fun way to pass the time but also serves as an engaging tool to develop various skills in individuals. The implementation of a Finite State Machine (FSM) in the digital dart game provides a robust framework to manage the various states of gameplay efficiently. This game emphasizes precision and timing, making it an excellent way to enhance focus and hand-eye coordination. </br></br>Through this project, we aim to create a digital version of the classic dart game using innovative digital circuits. By incorporating features like speed control and a dynamic scoreboard, players can easily track their scores while experiencing a customizable level of challenge as the game progresses. This adaptability adds an exciting layer of suspense and engagement to each round!

---

## 2. Problem Statement

- The system must accept input signals that accurately represent dart throws on a virtual dartboard.
- The dartboard must feature a sufficiently large number of distinct target regions, with the bullseye being the most challenging to hit.
- Additionally, the game should introduce variations to increase difficulty, ensuring a stimulating experience for players.
- The scoreboard must effectively record game points over a wide range, avoiding overflow to accommodate prolonged gameplay.
- The overall objective is to develop a digital dart game that is both entertaining and capable of accommodating multiple players while providing an intuitive and responsive gameplay experience.

---

## 3. Features

- The dartboard utilizes an input signal from a dart throw, represented as a time-varying pointer that periodically navigates among four concentric target regions, illuminated by LEDs to indicate the pointerâ€™s position.
- The scoreboard can accurately record at least 20 throws without risk of overflow, ensuring comprehensive tracking of player performance.
- The dartboard includes a variable speed controller, allowing players to adjust the speed at which the pointer changes position, enhancing the challenge.
- The game is designed for up to three players, promoting friendly competition and social interaction.
- A penalty will be imposed on the player if the throw time limit is exceeded.

## Hardware Implementation       


<details>
  <summary><strong>Salient Features</strong></summary><br>

  <summary><strong>PRBS Generator for Dartboard Patterns</strong></summary><br>

  The project involves the implementation of a **Pseudo-Random Bit Sequence (PRBS)** generator using **7474 D-type flip-flops** and **7486 XOR gates**. The PRBS generator produces a 15-bit sequence that controls the **dartboard patterns** displayed on a series of LEDs. The design employs a **Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR)** configuration, where the flip-flops store and shift binary data, and the XOR gates provide feedback to generate the random sequence. This sequence is then used to control the dynamic lighting of the dartboard, simulating random dart throws.

  The PRBS generator is initialized with a **seed value of 1**, which is set by selecting the **3rd** and **4th bits** of the sequence. This seed ensures that the sequence begins with a known state, from which the pseudo-random pattern evolves, providing consistent and predictable random behavior for the dartboard display.

  This implementation showcases the use of basic digital logic components to generate pseudo-random sequences, offering a cost-effective and reliable solution for creating random patterns in visual applications such as a dartboard simulation.


  <summary><strong>5-Bit BCD Address Logic Using 7483 ICs</strong></summary><br>

  The project utilizes a **5-bit BCD address** generated and maintained using **three 7483 4-bit binary full adder ICs**. Each IC handles the addition of BCD digits, ensuring the address remains within the valid range of 0 to 31 (decimal). The first two ICs handle the primary 4-bit BCD values, while the third IC manages carry propagation and overflow. This logic guarantees that the system can dynamically generate addresses for controlling various dartboard patterns.

  The carry-out from one IC feeds into the next, allowing for accurate address calculation and sequencing across the 5-bit range. This efficient address logic ensures smooth and reliable dartboard pattern control.
